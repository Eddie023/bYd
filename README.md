# Bootstrap Your Dream (bYd)
Serverless starter kit built with Golang, AWS, Terraform. The goal of this project is to provide cost-effective enterprise grade starting point to launch a new project into production. Largely inspired by my own experience working on production systems.

## High Level System Design Considerations:
1. The codebase is maintained such that it follows the [Clean Code Architecture](https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html)  which emphasizes the separation of concerns,  making codebase more maintainable, testable and scalable.
1. API Specification are described in 'openapi.yaml' file which follows OpenAPI 3.1 standard. API types are autogenerated using [oapi-codegen](github.com/deepmap/oapi-codegen/cmd/oapi-codegen) pkg. 
1. Keeping things simple by not relying heavily on third party tools for generating mocks, stubs. Creating tests that focus on the public methods of a package by separting with `_test` pkg. This is done to emphasize testing the external behaviour and API of the package rather than internal implementation details.
1. This codebase is fully Dockerized, enabling seamless local development and effortless production deployment to EKS or any other Kubernetes services if required. I have provided an example of how we can deploy the application to AWS Lambda as a Serverless application such that we can keep the cost of running the infrastructure as low as possible unless our SaaS starts to scale. 

## Running The Project Locally

### Setting up our database 
1. `make run` command will start our api server alongside postgresDB 
3. run `make migrate-up DB_CONNECTION_URI="postgres://root:postgres@localhost:5432/postgres?sslmode=disable"` 
3. Connect to your postgres using psql command `psql --host localhost --port 5432 --user root --db postgres` and run your seed script by copy pasting `./migrations/seeds/insert_fakes.sql`  

Test if you service is running as expected by using `make get-posts`
